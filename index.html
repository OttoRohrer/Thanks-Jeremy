<title>Thank you, Jeremy!</title>
<h1>Thank you, Jeremy!</h1>
<h1>This is a message to say thanks for all you've done.</h1>
<p>So, I'm trying to get a lot across with this message, but I'll start somewhere.
   First of all, I didn't reall know how to code before the Bootcamp.
   I could <em>write</em> code, but I couldn't <em>think</em> code.
   I knew syntax, but had very messy and "spaggheti" code.
   I wanted to learn how to <em>actually</em> code. Me and Dad thought about this for a while.
   But then we came across the Bootcamp. You all were on LVL.5 at the time. 
   Okay, we're going to stop for a sec there to say an initial thanks.
  Because I discovered the Bootcamp, but you <em>made</em> it. 
  And I know how much time and energy it took from you. But you did it. 
  And you did fullfill your dream: I learned to code. The right way, the supportive way. 
  Because of <em>you</em>. And all of the mentors. 
  And because of your <em>brilliant</em>, <em>supportive</em> way of teaching, I managed to code well.
  I was able to code efficiently and smartly, and I even cought up by LVL.9. 
  But still more than that! 
  Because of the way you still taught, and my newfound skills, I'm now completely up-to-date with the platform.
  And now that it's over, and now that I've learned so much stuff, I can <em>do things</em>.
  I can do pretty much whatever I want. Thanks to <em>you</em>.
  So I've rambled on a while, but I want to make it clear:
  I'm very grateful for all you've done to help me, and all you've done for me.
