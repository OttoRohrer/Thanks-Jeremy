<title>Thank you, Jeremy!</title>
<h1>Thank you, Jeremy!</h1>
<h1>This is a message to say thanks for all you've done.</h1>

Before I took the Bootcamp, I could barely code. I knew JS syntax, but that was it. I didn't know any good practices, or any other ways of thinking about code. I didn't like this, so Dad came in to help. He searched for good beginner platforms, and found the Bootcamp. We signed up right away. I dived right in, and soon discovered that the environment fit me well. Your video sessions and concepts pages gave a strong foundation in a new concept, and the exercises gave real-world scenarios to drive the point home. This was a perfect environment for me, and I accelerated. I was able to learn the content well, and had no pressure when a topic was difficult. So, in this amazing environment, I caught up with the group. I got to attend my first live session at Level 9. And I never fell behind again. In fact, when the interactive components of Part 2 came, and more and more Bootcampers fell behind, I didn't. I kept up-to-date with the platform, thanks to my previous Part 1 knowledge and my newfound front-end skills. This lasted until the very end, which is today. But not to worry! Thanks to my new knowledge, I can dive into the world of websites, and maybe someday make my own games. I know this might seem like a lot of rambling, so I want to make it clear: I'm very grateful for all you've done to help me, and all you've done for me.
