<title>Thank you, Jeremy!</title>
<h1>Thank you, Jeremy!</h1>
<h1>This is a message to say thanks for all you've done.</h1>

Before I took the Bootcamp, I could barely code. I knew some JS syntax, but that was it. I didn't really know any good practices or mental models. I didn't like this, so Dad came in to help. Luckily, he found the Bootcamp, and we signed up about a month late. I dived right in and soon discovered that the environment fit me very well. Your video sessions and concepts pages gave a strong foundation in a new concept, and the exercises gave real-world scenarios to drive the point home. This was a perfect environment for me, so I accelerated. I was able to learn the content well. So, in this amazing environment, I caught up with the group. I got to attend my first live session at Level 9. And I never fell behind again. This lasted until the very end, which was today. But not to worry! Thanks to my new knowledge, I can dive into the world of websites, and maybe someday make my own games. To show my gratitude, I decided to make a thank-you website with animations. I based the exercise icons off of exercises that I felt were milestones for me, and the star is meant to represent skill. If you'd like to view it again, just refresh!
