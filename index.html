<h1>Thank you, Jeremy!</h1>
<h2>This is a message to say thanks for all you've done.</h2>
<p>So, I'm trying to get a lot across with this message, but I will start somewhere.
   First of all, I didn't reall know how to code before the Bootcamp.
   I could <em>write</em> code, but I couldn't <em>think</em> code.
   I knew syntax, but had very messy and "spaggheti" code.
   I wanted to learn how to <em>actually</em> code. Me and Dad thought about this for a while.
   But then we came across the Bootcamp. You all were on LVL.5 at the time. 
   Okay, we're going to stop for a sec there to say an initial thanks.
  Because I discovered the Bootcamp, but you <em>made</em> it. 
  And I know how much time and energy it took from you. But you did it. 
  And you did fullfill your dream: I learned to code. The right way, the supportive way. 
  Because of <em>you</em>. And all of the mentors.
